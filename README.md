### **Installation Process**  
1. Download the game files listed below. These are source code files, but you don’t need to compile them manually—just use the **Compile&Run** batch file included to automatically compile and execute the games.  
2. Everything is open-source, so you can review and modify the code as needed.  

### **Game List**  
- `Hangman.java`  
- `TextAdventureGame.java`  
- `TextSnakeGame.java`  

### **Malware-Free Guarantee**  
Since these games are open-source, you can inspect the code yourself to ensure they are safe. However, for extra security, you can scan the files using online tools like [Triage](https://tria.ge) or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) before running them.

This keeps it clear and highlights that **Compile&Run** is your custom script. Let me know if you want any more tweaks!
